## Cities Navigation System

Welcome to the Cities Navigation System repository! This project is a semester undertaking, featuring a user-friendly command-line application designed to assist users in exploring and navigating through various cities and provinces.

### Key Features:
Find the shortest path between two cities using Dijkstra's algorithm.
Search for cities based on their first letter or by province name.
Display a complete map of cities along with distances.
Add new cities and edges to the navigation graph.
Update distances between cities for accurate navigation.
The project is built using C++ and incorporates essential concepts of data structures and algorithms. It demonstrates our proficiency in programming, graph theory, and problem-solving.
